> ***“MiAmigos”** is a collection of colorful and friendly NFT characters that serves as a guild tool that connects Web3 communities, merch, gamification, and sustainable value. The collection is being created through a strategic partnership with **Red Planet DNA** and other projects within the **[AMIGO Guild](https://medium.com/@redplanetdao/amigo-guild-web3-community-synchronisation-protocol-ea231e49902a)**.*

> *When Purt the Adventurer returned from an expedition to the meteor fields of Nebulos, he didn’t bring back artifacts or another armful of beans. He returned with an idea that could unite the nations, communities, and most dedicated citizens of the Red Planet into one powerful guild. Thus, **“MiAmigos”** was born — a meme-collection of NFTs born in the dusty canyons and ideological heart of the **Red Planet DNA**.*
>
> *To cement the brotherhood on the blockchain, we are releasing the meme-collection of NFTs **“MiAmigos”**. Each NFT is not just a token, it is a membership, it is a style, it is a title. Owners of **“MiAmigos”** will be able to participate in closed events, receive additional drops and, perhaps, manage the guild together with Purt.*

**“MiAmigos”** is a unique guild NFT product that combines:

- **Fun visual aesthetics and youth-oriented merch**  
- **Gamified mechanics and drops**  
- **Sustainable provision through the Red Planet DAO mining economy**

The collection creates an **ecosystem of utility** accessible to all guild members and will become a **starting point** for future large-scale Web3 initiatives of the AMIGO community.

***Main utilities of “MiAmigos”***

*I. Raffles and community activity (Roll mechanics)*

- NFT “MiAmigos” will become **the main tool for roll raffles, contests and interactive events** within the guild.

*II. Brand and merch*

- Based on the characters of “MiAmigos”, a **children’s brand of stickers and merch** is being created. The products will be sold on external marketplaces, and the **proceeds will be used to provide** the collection, increasing its sustainability and value.

*III. NFT as a secured receipt*

- Each NFT “MiAmigos” will act as a **digital receipt** associated with an NFT from the [Red Planet DNA](https://redplanetdna.com/) project. Thanks to this, “MiAmigos” will be **secured by assets with mining profitability**, making the collection more sustainable and long-term.  
- The stability of the collection will grow proportionally to the involvement and activity in the **Red Planet DNA** and guild communities, creating an “energy support” effect.

*IV. Red Planet DAO Scaling Support*

- The revenue and activity from “MiAmigos” will be **partially used to support the mint and scaling** of [Red Planet](https://www.stargaze.zone/l/stars1vk8fmh259xr4yz9qqh4x3xfrck80nvl9fu6d9gcaqjksx94xc6nqxzea0t) NFT and the construction of a **joint mining farm** for all Red Planet NFT holders. This creates mutual benefits for both “MiAmigos” and the Red Planet DAO and the entire guild.

***Utility for NFT holders***

*“MiAmigos” NFT holders will receive the following benefits:*

- **PFP avatars** — the ability to set the NFT as a profile picture.  
- **Reward distribution** — participation in regular drops, competitions and roll-ups.  
- **Guild products** — some physical merch and in-game assets will be distributed among NFT holders.
